Basics about Algorithm:

Low bound theory:
    Define how much time complexity at least the program would consume。
    Given L(n) as time complexity for a program, if exists constant C, N where L(n) >= C*g(n) for n > N, then lower bound theory is g(n)
    
Upper bound theory:
    Similar to lower bound, if exists constant C, N where L(n) <= C*g(n) for n > N, then lower bound theory is g(n)
    
    
Space complexity:
    Memory consumed for the program.
